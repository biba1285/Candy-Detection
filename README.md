# 🍬 Candy Detection with YOLO  

📝 **Description**  
A deep learning project that detects and classifies different types of candies in images using **YOLO** object detection models.  
The app is deployed with **Streamlit**, allowing users to upload images and instantly visualize detected candies with bounding boxes, labels, and confidence scores.  

This project is designed as a complete end-to-end object detection pipeline suitable for showcasing deep learning and computer vision skills.

⚙️ **Technologies Used**  
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Streamlit, Ultralytics YOLO,  NumPy, Pillow

---

🧠 **Model Applied**  
✅ YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model  
✅ Confidence threshold filtering (default 0.25)  
✅ Real-time image upload and detection  
✅ Visualization of bounding boxes and labels
